ReCodeIt is a .net assembly tool for working with obfuscated assemblies. It allows you to deobfuscate using de4dot, create remaps for types and generated a re-mapped reference for your project. It has two main components. The GUI pictured above and a CLI companion that can be placed on the system path for access anywhere on your machine at any given time.
