Then patch your assembly back to original types, for testing/production.\n- This will allow for ultimate flexibility in being version agnostic as the manual re-mapper is able to find things between versions by creating patterns for it to match. It works in the same fashion as using LINQ at runtime, because that's essentially what it is.\n- Below is how your build process would be effected."},

Once you are ready to compile, you will compile the dll as normal and place ReCodeIt on your sys path somewhere, then run a post build command to have ReCodeit patch your assembly back to original Type data."}
